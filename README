Plasmoid I wrote long ago, my first iirc.

"A Plasmoid widget written in Python that displays a web page on your desktop. Unlike the web browser applet, Web Fetch keeps an (text-only) offline copy of the web page and displays the copy when Internet connection is not present. The offline copy is synced with the actual web page periodically.

If Internet is available, the Plasmoid can load hyperlinks and perform many other functions expected of a regular web browser.

Basically written to scratch the itch of the default web browser applet being miserable without Internet :P

This is my first Plasmoid and Python work, so please be patient if things don't work well :) If you like you can notify me about issues here and I'll see what I can do."
